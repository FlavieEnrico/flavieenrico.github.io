        <h1>Swarm: What if climate deniers were poets?</h1>
        <div class="width-50">
            <h2>Abstract:</h2>
            <p>How to understand misinformation about global warming? Swarm is media literacy research consisting of a critical study of climate denial in three languages: French, English and Spanish. This research is a follow-up to the Critical Climate Machine project, an artistic environment designed to reveal and quantify the misleading information circulating on the web. Here, the result of our work is a dataset published online, accompanied by an algorithm trained in the detection of misinformation.

            <h2>Haikus:</h2>
            <p>A haiku, a short poem of Japanese origin, can be found in different forms. In its original form, it consists of 3 lines, each being made of 5, 7 and 5 syllables respectively. In our collection, you can also find Argentinian haikus. To write one, select a 3-syllable word that will be banned from the poem. The haiku must then include the 3 different syllables, distributed in the first words of each line.</p>
